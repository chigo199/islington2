What causes clouds?

A cloud is classified as 'a visible  combination of tiny droplets of water or particles of ice or a mixture of both floating in the air. Each droplet has a diameter of approximately a hundredth of a millimeter and each cubic meter of air will consist of 100 million droplets. 
Because the droplets are so miniscule, they can remain in liquid form in temperatures of -30 °C. If so, they are viewed as supercooled droplets.

Clouds at higher and extremely cold levels in the atmosphere are formed of ice crystals - these can be about a tenth of a millimeter long.

Clouds form when the invisible water vapor in the air converts into visible water droplets or ice crystals. For this to take place, the parcel of air must be saturated, i.e. unable to hold all the water it contains in vapor form, so it starts to condense into a liquid or solid form. There are two forms by which saturation is acheived.

(a) By increasing the water content in the air, e.g. through evaporation, to an extent where the air can hold no further.  
 
(b) By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation may take place, and is unable to 'hold' any more water. Figure 1 shows how there is a maximum amount of water vapor the air, at a given temperature, can hold. In general, the warmer the air, the more water vapor it can hold. Therefore, subsiding its temperature decreases its ability to consist of vapor so that condensation occurs.

Method (b) is the most implemented method that clouds are produced, and it is associated with air rising in the lower part of the atmosphere. As the air rises it expands due to lower atmospheric pressure, and the energy used in expansion causes the air to cool. Generally speaking, for each 100 meters/330 feet which the air rises, it will cool by 1 °C, as shown in Figure 2. The rate of cooling will vary depending on the water content, or humidity, of the air. Moist parcels of air may cool more slowly, at a rate of 0.5 ° C per 100 meters/330 feet.
